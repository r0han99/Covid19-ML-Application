## DeepLearning ( Precondition Based Prognosis )

* _A Multi-Layered Perceptron Model which was trained on an enormous COVID19 Patient records, Can accurately predict the likelihood of requiring an **Intensive Care unit** and **Intubation** if he/she ever tests positive for COVID-19. This section also presents Analytical Insights of people whose Age, and Pre-Conditions are the Absolute same as yours. This should create a critical awareness of the situation in a numerical sense._
