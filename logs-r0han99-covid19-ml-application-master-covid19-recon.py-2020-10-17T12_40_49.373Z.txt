    Running setup.py install for fbprophet: finished with status 'done'
  DEPRECATION: fbprophet was installed using the legacy 'setup.py install' method, because a wheel could not be built for it. pip 21.0 will remove support for this functionality. A possible replacement is to fix the wheel build issue reported above. You can find discussion regarding this at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8368.
ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

fbprophet 0.7.1 requires pandas>=1.0.4, but you'll have pandas 1.0.3 which is incompatible.

  DEPRECATION: fbprophet was installed using the legacy 'setup.py install' method, because a wheel could not be built for it. pip 21.0 will remove support for this functionality. A possible replacement is to fix the wheel build issue reported above. You can find discussion regarding this at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8368.
ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

fbprophet 0.7.1 requires pandas>=1.0.4, but you'll have pandas 1.0.3 which is incompatible.

  DEPRECATION: fbprophet was installed using the legacy 'setup.py install' method, because a wheel could not be built for it. pip 21.0 will remove support for this functionality. A possible replacement is to fix the wheel build issue reported above. You can find discussion regarding this at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/8368.
ERROR: After October 2020 you may experience errors when installing or updating packages. This is because pip will change the way that it resolves dependency conflicts.

We recommend you use --use-feature=2020-resolver to test your packages with the new resolver before it becomes the default.

fbprophet 0.7.1 requires pandas>=1.0.4, but you'll have pandas 1.0.3 which is incompatible.
